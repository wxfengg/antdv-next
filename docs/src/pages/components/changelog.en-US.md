## V1.3.0

Release Date: 2026-05-16

This release focuses on **syncing ant-design to 6.4.2, introducing the new BorderBeam component, migrating Notification / Message / Typography to antd v2 semantic structure, and expanding ConfigProvider coverage**, while also fixing **TypeScript bundler deep-subpath type resolution, Message transition mismatch, Notification close button spacing when title is empty, and Image popup.close semantic key naming**.

> ⚠️ This release contains breaking changes — see the **Breaking Changes** section below.

**✨ Features**

* feat: sync ant-design@6.4.2, covering Calendar / Splitter / Image / Wave / Modal / Drawer / ConfigProvider / Table / Tabs / Form / Menu / Tag / Tree / Tour / Typography / Notification / Message
* feat(border-beam): introduce the BorderBeam glow border component with docs, demos, and unit tests
* feat(typography): migrate to antd 6.4 v2 semantic structure; add `actions.placement` for action button group position; new `root` / `actions` / `action` / `textarea` semantic keys
* feat(notification): upgrade to vc-notification@2 with full v2 semantic slots `title` / `description` / `icon` / `actions` / `progress` / `close`; add `_InternalListDoNotUseOrYouWillBeFired` internal component for doc previews
* feat(message): sync antd 6.4 v2 semantic structure (`title` / `wrapper` / `list` / `listContent`); add `_InternalListDoNotUseOrYouWillBeFired`
* feat(form): add `help` / `helpItem` / `extra` semantic class and style support
* feat(transfer): add nested `source` / `target` semantic overrides — customize `section` / `header` / `title` / `body` / `list` / `item` / `itemIcon` / `itemContent` / `footer` per side
* feat(calendar): add `itemContent` semantic class and style
* feat(modal, tour, tag, popconfirm, image, statistic, tree, tree-select, input, popconfirm): add `close` / `icon` / `clear` / `value` / `itemSwitcher` semantic class/style support
* feat(config-provider): extend global component config for Select `allowClear` / `showSearch` / `loadingIcon`, DatePicker / TimePicker `allowClear` / `clearIcon`, Modal infoIcon/successIcon/warningIcon/errorIcon, Upload `progress` / `accept`, Modal / Drawer `focusable`, Mentions `allowClear`, Cascader icons, and more
* feat(menu): refresh item extra layout and tooltip padding
* feat(mentions): wire the popup z-index through `useZIndex`
* feat(cascader): support ConfigProvider `searchIcon` / `clearIcon` / `removeIcon` / `suffixIcon`
* feat(table): support ConfigProvider column defaults with per-column merge
* feat: upgrade vc-notification@2.0.0-rc.4, vc-input@1.1.0-rc.3, vc-picker@1.1.0-rc.3, vc-table@1.1.0-rc.2, vc-select@1.1.0-rc.1, vc-slider@1.1.0-rc.1, vc-resize-observer@1.1.0-rc.1, vc-tour@1.1.0-rc.2 etc.

**💥 Breaking Changes**

* **typography**: `classes.copy` / `classes.edit` / `classes.expand` / `classes.content` (and matching `styles.*`) are removed. Migrate to the unified `classes.action` / `styles.action` (single action button) and `classes.actions` / `styles.actions` (actions container).
* **message**: `classes.content` / `styles.content` are removed — use `classes.title` / `styles.title` instead. DOM moves from `notice-description > .custom-content` to `notice-title`, and the type modifier class moves from the root to `notice-wrapper`.
* **transfer**: `classes.source` / `classes.target` change from flat strings to nested objects. The old `classes={ source: 'foo' }` becomes `classes={ source: { section: 'foo' } }`.
* **image**: `classes.popup.closeIcon` / `styles.popup.closeIcon` are renamed to `popup.close` / `popup.close`, aligning with the underlying vc-image naming.

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(pkg): add `index.d.ts` fallback to the `./dist/*` subpath exports — resolves TypeScript `moduleResolution: bundler` / `nodenext` failing to resolve deep type imports
* fix(message): switch the transition class from `move-up` to `fade`, restoring antd 6.x enter/leave animation
* fix(message): promote the icon from inline description into the v2 icon semantic slot
* fix(notification): pad description with `padding-inline-end` when the notice is closable but has no title — prevents the close button from overlapping description text
* fix(notification): position via `--notification-top` / `--notification-bottom` CSS variables to stop the holder from spanning full height
* fix(notification, message): re-add the v1 icon-wrapper class for backward compatibility
* fix(notification): in vc-notification, drop the broken onClose array merge and the invalid TransitionGroup tag (vc-notification 2.0.0-rc.2/rc.3 follow-ups)
* fix(border-beam): adjust the `offsetPath` corner radius from `200px` to `100px` so the beam no longer breaks at corners

**📝 Documentation & Demos**

* docs: add Notification / Message / Typography / Form / Transfer / Tag / Tour / Modal / Image / Calendar / Statistic / Tree / TreeSelect / Input / Popconfirm semantic DOM preview demos with bilingual locale copy
* docs(notification, message): refactor the style-class demo to match React 6.4's green/red function-style example
* docs(border-beam): add zh-CN / en-US component docs, demos, and sidebar registration

**🔄 Internal**

* upgrade vc-notification to 2.0.0-rc.4 (full v2 semantic structure + height patcher fix + leave animation fix)
* bump vc-input / vc-picker / vc-select / vc-table / vc-slider / vc-resize-observer / vc-tour / vc-notification rc versions — see catalog for details
* upgrade vc-overflow to 1.1.0-rc.1 (RTL logical offset fix)
